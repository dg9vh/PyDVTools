# NXDNPentester
This tool is for penetration tests on NXDNReflectors (or compatible using NXDN-
protocol for communication). Within the ini-file you can set some parameters
for target-connection itself, the prefix that is used for client-connection-
naming and the number of connections to be established to the reflector.

The test itself then connects n times with different client names to the
given reflector and so produces n audiostreams to be created and transported
by the reflector. By increasing the number of connections you can test out
the maximum client count to be managed by your reflector without audio-
disturbtion.

Only use this on your own reflectors or after communication with the reflector
owner!
